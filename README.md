A multi function discord bot.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine

### Prerequisites

You need to install the following


* https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas
* sequelize-cli (``npm install -g sequelize-cli``)
* mysql
* ffmpeg (Optional but recommanded: for all command that require to interact with voice chat and [vid2gif.js](commands/utility/vid2gif.js) and [vidshittifier.js](commands/fun/vidshittifier.js))
* handbrake-cli (Optional but recommanded: for [download.js](commands/utility/download.js))
* apngasm (Optional: for [nolight.js](commands/images/nolight.js))
* [Google credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) (Optional: for [tts.js](commands/fun/tts/tts.js) and [ttsvc.js](commands/fun/tts/ttsvc.js), without that it will spam error on startup but not important)
* Wine (Optional: required for linux/mac for [dectalk.js](commands/fun/tts/dectalk.js) and [dectalkvc.js](commands/fun/tts/dectalkvc.js))
* xvfb (Optional: for wine if using headless server)

### Installing
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/loicbersier/discordbot
cd discordbot
npm install

sequelize db:migrate
```

If the youtube-dl module didn't install youtube-dl by himself you can go in ``node_modules/youtube-dl/scripts`` and run ``node download.js``
Configure config.json and config/config.json

To run the bot either use pm2
```
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start index.js --name(insert name)
```
or node
```
node index.js
```
If on linux you can also do
```
nohup node index.js &
```

To use dectalk on linux you will need
1. Get dectalk 
2. install wine
3. install Xvfb & run `Xvfb :0 -screen 0 1024x768x16 &`

You can now use the python script [buildConfig.py](https://gitlab.com/LoicBersier/DiscordBot/blob/master/buildConfig.py) to build a config.json ( Might be outdated )
